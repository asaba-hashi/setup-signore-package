## What

A [setup-signore](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-signore) alternative for Linux GitHub Runners.
Extracts a binary from the Signore Docker image on GitHub Packages to the local disk.

## Why

- the setup-signore GitHub Action requires users to supply a GitHub personal access token
- this version automatically uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` vended to a running Action to authenticate to the GitHub container registry (ghcr.io)

## Limitations

- Linux only, because macOS workers do not have Docker installed, and Windows workers have other unexplored issues
  - Incidentally, look how [fun](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/contrib/download-frozen-image-v2.sh) it is to "pull" a Docker image without Docker

## Permissions

One security best practice to keep in mind when configuring your GitHub Actions is [least privilege](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege). GitHub grants a [wide variety of scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) to a GitHub Action's `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default. Whenever possible, you should specify granularly scoped permissions to confine your workflows to their intended uses.

If specify granular permissions, be sure to include the `package: read` scope. This allows your action to use its `GITHUB_TOKEN` to pull the `signore` Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry.

```yaml
permissions:
  packages: read
```

Read more about [permissions for `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token).

## How

Add a step to your workflow like so:

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: install signore
        uses: hashicorp/setup-signore-package@v1
```

With no inputs, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is passed automatically, and a default version of `signore` is used.

Optionally, `token`, `version`, and `signer` can be set:

```
    steps:
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-signore-package@v1
        with:
          version: v0
          signer: test_signer
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
